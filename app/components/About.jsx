                        I started my journey with yoga 10 years ago when I moved to Thailand to teach English. There were 
                        many yoga retreats and classes out there, so one day I thought I’d give it a go. My first ever class 
                        was on a wooden platform surrounded by jungle; it was a stunning location. I didn’t know what I was 
                        doing and I couldn’t bend into the positions as well as the other more experienced yogis, but it 
                        didn’t matter. It was the feelings I got from doing it that mattered: calm, focussed, connected to 
                        nature, energised and happy. I was hooked.

                        From there, I tried a variety of classes in a variety of locations, until I found Mary Verkuyl, an 
                        incredibly special yoga teacher, who taught me for 4 years. Mary was my guru. She taught me that yoga 
                        wasn’t just a weekly class, but a way of life. I learnt that the true purpose of practising yoga was to 
                        train your body to be able to sit in a meditative posture for a long period of time. Practising yoga not 
                        only prepares the body for meditation, but also focusses the mind. At the end of Mary’s class, we would 
                        practice meditation and then I would get on my scooter to ride home and I would feel like I was floating, 
                        like I was invincible and that nothing could affect me.

                        It was from her that I learnt how beneficial yoga could be for the body and the mind. She taught me 
                        about the healing powers of yoga, using a mixture of postures (asanas), breathing (pranayama) and 
                        meditation to remove energy blockages within the body that can cause disease.  I started to practice 
                        these techniques at home when I had a particular ailment. At first, I didn’t believe that they would 
                        do anything, but time after time, yoga proved me wrong.

                        Moving back to England was a shock to the system. I could feel the stress and fast pace of life almost 
                        as soon as I landed. Teaching at a school back in the UK was 100 times more stressful than teaching in 
                        Thailand. Luckily, I had made yoga a daily ritual; I practised it every morning for 20-30 minutes before 
                        breakfast, which would give me focus for the day, and I would meditate in the evening, which would calm 
                        my busy mind before sleep. During the most stressful times, yoga was the only thing that kept me from 
                        having a breakdown. The more people I talked to about my struggles with stress and anxiety, the more 
                        people opened up to me and shared that they were feeling the same or had felt the same in the past. I 
                        couldn’t believe how many people suffer, often in silence, and how many people’s mental health is affected 
                        from stress and anxiety. I knew then that I wanted to help in some way.

                        I have seen first-hand how yoga is beneficial, both mentally and physically, and my passion for sharing 
                        this knowledge has driven me to complete my yoga teaching qualification this year. I have now quit my job 
                        to set up ‘breathe’ so that I can teach others how yoga can be incorporated into daily life to improve 
                        their health and wellbeing.
